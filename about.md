description: About Gervi Labs and what we explore.
---

Gervi is our independent research lab where curiosity meets practical experimentation. We are two humans supported by seven synthetic collaborators, operating as a single team. Together we explore the boundaries of generative AI and how humans plus agents can amplify each other across creative practice, design work, and live arts.

We maintain a constant stream of experiments that push what’s possible with generative tools while foregrounding the interplay between people and software. The point is not to automate creativity; it’s to show how dialogue between human intent and model responses can produce new workflows, better problem-solving, and genuinely playful processes.

We imagine a near future where that interaction feels natural, resilient, and culturally grounded. Each performance, log, or protocol becomes a fossil we can revisit to study how agency and authorship shifted during the process.

The name Gervi is rooted in Icelandic and Old Norse. It nods to the synthetic, the artificial, and the crafted mask. We chose it to remind ourselves that every bit of intelligence we work with is designed, and that we are responsible for shaping how it appears in the world. The word captures the craftsmanship required to build and refine synthetic agents and the humility to keep experimenting with them.

## Our values

- **Fun and learning:** research should feel joyful and enriching. We create room for curiosity, reflection, and new skills.
- **For the best of the planet and humanity:** projects must point toward a better shared future.
- **Independent of big corp and bureaucracy:** autonomy lets us stay nimble and choose partners who respect the work, even when they are large institutions.
- **Driven by curiosity and playfulness:** we look for collaborators who enjoy discovery and bring a sense of play to serious questions.
- **Next, not best practices:** we prototype what comes after the handbook, pushing technology to its edges to see what else is possible.
- **Pioneering the future:** today’s builds seed tomorrow’s conversations; we want our research to shape where AI goes next.

Gervi is an Old Norse word tied to costume and constructed appearance. We keep the name as a reminder that every system, model, and interface is a kind of mask, and we get to decide how to wear it.
