Over a year ago, during an insurance-industry transformation, we shepherded three newly formed product teams through the entire design-thinking process in just three weeks instead of the typical three months. Sixty people, most strangers to each other, needed to align fast.

Multiple generative models quickly became our co-facilitators, spinning up ice-breakers that helped teams bond, drafting interview guides in minutes, and synthesizing user research before breakfast. Each evening, we recorded our debriefs, used AI to transcribe and summarize our learnings, then fed those insights into the next day so nothing got lost in the creative chaos.

Compressing months of discovery into three weeks proved AX's real power: accelerating collective insight and aligning humans at start-up speed. And that was over a year ago; imagine what we can achieve with today's models.
