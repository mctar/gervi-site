  <h2>Current focus</h2>
  <div class="section-body">
    <p>
      Gervi Labs is an independent research lab focused on how people and synthetic agents interact, create,
      and share control. We are two humans supported by several AI collaborators. Our work spans performance,
      creative practice, applied design, and long-form research.
    </p>
    <p>
      We build agents, sensors, and tools that let groups experience new forms of interaction with synthetic
      systems. Some prototypes become performances. Others become internal protocols or research material. Each
      experiment helps us understand how agency shifts when humans and machines work together and leaves a digital
      fossil for future study.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work globally from Norway with festivals, conferences, institutions, companies, and research groups.

  <h2>AX Manifesto</h2>
  <div class="section-body">
    <p>
      AX (AI Experience) captures our principles for designing with intelligent, adaptive systems. It blends model-first
      empathy, probabilistic thinking, and continuous learning loops so humans and agents can share control without
      losing trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manifesto outlines ten principles plus real-world stories, exercises, and deliverables. It’s how we design
      products that feel conversational rather than mechanical.

  <h2>Work with us</h2>
  <div class="section-body">
    <p>
      We collaborate with festivals, museums, universities, companies, and research groups. If you want to prototype
      a new performance format, explore AX (AI experience), or bring a synthetic collaborator into your own practice,
      talk to us.
