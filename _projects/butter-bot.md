2025 is the year of the butter-bot. Tiny micro pain-killers that tackle one job flawlessly, then get out of the way. Think Rick & Morty’s existential butter-bot, but aimed at the annoying chores that lurk between creative sprints.

This week we put the theory to the test with sub-20-minute sprints and shipped four fresh butter-bots, each born from a very specific itch:

- **Speedometer (speed):** live km/h and knot readouts while breaking in a new outboard engine.
- **Time Zone Tango (tango):** instant yes/no on whether Paris, Pune, San Francisco, New York, Singapore, and Melbourne can meet at the same time.
- **Disagreement Dial (disagree):** a fast way to tune any LLM chatbot from sycophant to squabbler, depending on the bite resistance you need.
- **Conversions (convert):** an ultra-quick converter across the temperature, weight, and length units that clog our muscle memory.

All tools were built from scratch to scratch my own itches—no dashboards, no Swiss-army contraptions, no ads, no subscriptions. Just single-purpose delight that does one thing right and then bows out.

### Why micro pain-killers

- Generative tools flipped us from tool users into tool makers; the distance between idea and artifact is now minutes.
- One sharp solution beats a hundred half-baked features, especially when context switching is the real tax.
- If it takes less time to build a butter-bot than to evaluate an off-the-shelf tool, I build the butter-bot.

When it makes sense, these butter-bots speak MCP so future butter-agents can string them together. Ideally none of them have an existential crisis along the way.

More butter-bots are already brewing. What tiny pain would you automate first? Drop an idea and we’ll prototype a new pain-killer. Kick the tyres at [btrbot.com](https://btrbot.com/).
