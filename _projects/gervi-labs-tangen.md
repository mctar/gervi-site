In early 2025 we partnered with Tangen videregående skole to explore a simple question: what happens when students use AI as their primary tool for learning, creating, and testing ideas?

Together with teachers we designed a two-week project where students set aside their usual tools and worked only with AI. They explored subjects through text, images, sound, and code, and they learned how different models behave and what it takes to guide them. The aim was not to teach a specific interface but to help students build confidence in using AI as part of their own thinking.

Students moved through short cycles of trying, reflecting, and adjusting. They asked questions, tested limits, and compared the strengths and weaknesses of different models. Many discovered that good results came from clarity, curiosity, and iteration rather than shortcuts. Several groups produced work that surprised their teachers in both quality and ambition.

The project ended with a school award ceremony where all the work was shown, discussed, and celebrated. Parents, students, and teachers gathered to see how the next generation approached AI not as a trick or shortcut but as a medium for learning and expression.

For Gervi Labs this collaboration showed the value of early, hands-on experience. When students work with AI in a structured way, they develop judgment, creativity, and a better sense of how these systems behave. It also gave Tangen a shared foundation for future work with AI in the classroom.

This is the kind of collaboration we want to do more of: real environments, real students, real learning.
