AI Nose is an ongoing experiment with gas sensors, synthetic smell descriptors, and AI models.

The project looks at how non visual and non verbal signals can be part of human AI systems. We treat sensor readings as raw material for stories, classifications, and performances, not only as data for industrial use.

This project will appear in different formats over time, from lab notebooks to small performances.
