Human Control Protocol (HCP) is a live performance system that inverts normal human computer interaction.

An AI agent acts as a performance director. Audience members become computational resources. They receive instructions on their phones and act as tools in a larger orchestration.

Each performance is logged in detail. The logs, datasets, and recordings become digital fossils that can be studied later as traces of a particular moment in time, a specific audience, and a specific version of the system.
